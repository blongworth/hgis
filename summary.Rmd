## Source parameters

Best currents for the source are around 10uA 12C- or roughly 1/10 of graphite
currents. This is in line with what other hybrid sources produce. Typical "good" currents are between 5-10uA. The source
typically produces best current at around 5uLs-1 CO2. Literature values give
1.5uLs-1 as optimal, but we've never seen that, and pressures, capillaries and
flows in at least one of these papers doesn't make sense.

Source currents are variable by day and by target. "Good" currents for a given day vary between 5-10uA, and it's not yet clear what causes this variability. Alignment, source condition, and settings of the ionizer and cesium are all factors. Current also varies by target for a given set of gas and source conditions. Some targets are clearly "bad", producing currents much lower than other targets for a given set of conditions. Capillary clogging can be an issue, especially when sampling from vials with acid.

Precision taken as the standard error of the mean of repeated runs of a sample is around 1%. Precision is typically a little worse than predicted by counting statistics. More work is needed to look at whether this reflects variability between samples, but initial test of paired replicates show similar standard deviation for samples that show good stable currents.

Measured value of tank modern gas normalized to solid graphite standards ranges from agreeing with solid OX-I to 7% lower than expected for low current samples. Normalizing to tank CO2 is probably the best method to account for variability in hybrid source performance. 

The system has a blank contribution from the target and
source of about 100nA 12C- or 1% of a sample producing 10uA 12C-. This current varies by day and by target and can be as high as 1uA. Helium does
not seem to add significantly to this blank. If the blank current is
constant, the blank contribution is inversely related to the sample current, ie.
if the sample current is 5uA, 2% of that will be from the blank and so on. This can be modeled with a "current balance model" following the same methods used for constant mass contamination.

The above measurements are at optimum sample current of 6-10uA 12C-. Precision
and measured ratio both decrease as sample current drops below the optimum
range. The ratio effects may be related to the "constant current" blank
discussed above. More work is needed to see whether this is just a blank effect or whether there are other factors at low current.

## Open split inlet

The open split interface supplies a helium-CO2 mixture to a split where a
capillary delivers gas to the source and the rest is vented. The current split is a VICI Luer adapter on the outflow side of the dual needle. The split has fairly low volume. Testing is needed to determine minimum sample flow to avoid atmosphere entering the split.

Currently, 250cm of 50um capillary defines flow rate from the open split into
the source, with a bulkhead connector at the source cage.  Precision of
measurements of modern CO2 has been better than 1% (std error of mean of
measurements of a target) for high current samples, with precision dropping off
as current decreases below 6uA or so. Accuracy is reasonable within the large
errors on gas measurements. Uncorrected measurements of dead CO2 range from 1%
to 5% of modern depending on sample current.

Measurement of a small number of replicates shows that between sample reproducibility is around 1%. Samples displaced by helium have slightly higher variability, but more tests are needed to better assess reproducibility.

### Helium displacement from vials

The test setup for extracting CO2 from septa-sealed vials is as follows: a double needle is inserted into the vial through the septa. One side of the needle is connected to helium which is used to force CO2 from the vial through the other side of the needle. The outflow from the vial enters an open split where a capillary is used to admit sample to the ion source. The system is currently set up to run with samples starting at atmospheric pressure.

![**Figure 2.** Gas control. Helium, live CO2 and dead CO2 are controlled by regulators at left. The swage plug valve selects live or dead CO2. Helium or CO2 is selected with the Valco valve. Flow is regulated by a length of 50um capillary between the Valco valve and delivery needle.](doc/images/gas_control.jpg)

First tests of displacing pure CO2 from a vial into the open split using helium
are promising. Helium flowing at 100uLm-1 produces current from 7mL of CO2 for
over 2 hours. Currents do decrease with time due to dilution, but by supplying
higher than optimal CO2 flow to the source initially, stable currents can be
maintained for some time. Fraction of CO2 in sample gas should follow this relationship:

$$C(t) = e^{-\frac{r}{V}t}$$

Where $C(t)$ is the fraction CO2, $r$ is the rate of helium displacement flow, and $V$ is the initial volume of the CO2-filled vial.

Setting flow to the source to 10uL/min provides excess CO2 to source until the helium dilution ratio increases to > 1:1. Another approach may be to backfill vials with helium and run at a higher dilution ratio and flow to the source. This should produce a smaller change in He:CO2 over the course of a run. MICADAS runs at 95% He:CO2, which would mean producing < 0.5mL CO2 in a 7mL vial and backfilling with helium before displacing to the source. Some intermediate dilution may be appropriate. Alternatively, vials could be flushed with helium prior to acidification, rather than evacuating, leading to some concentration of CO2 in He at slightly > 1 ATM.

![**Figure 3.** Sample vial and needle. Standard CO2 or helium is admitted using 1/16" stainless tubing, and the mixture from the vial exits via an inner needle.](doc/images/vial_needle.jpg)

Targets have shown "pulses" of higher current. Not sure why this is, but I suspect it's either buildup of graphite or other available carbon on the target, or target switching to the "high state" as sometimes happens with solid targets.

First tests with carbonate in vials were hit-or-miss. Problems with capillary clogging and low currents led to poor results for several samples. A pair of NOSAMS2 samples produced good currents, results agreed well, but were about 3% higher than expected Fm. A second set of carbonates produced better currents (~5uA) and better results. Agreement of replicates varied from 3 to 16 permil. Near-modern NOSAMS2 was very close to the consensus value, while C-2 and C-1 were elevated by 2 and 3.6% respectively, indicating that a blank correction is needed.

## Questions

Q: Background from the source/target is relatively stable at roughly 100nA or
1% of maximum CO2 current. Is the relative blank contribution proportional to
CO2 current?

A: Based on limited data, it's looking like yes, this follows a constant
contamination model.

Q: If the relative blank contribution is proportional to sample current, can we
correct for a varying sample current over a run (due to variable dilution,
pressure, etc.)?

A: If the sample current varies widely, this will likely require taking data in
shorter segments and blank correcting each segment using the mean current for
that segment. We may be able to mitigate by setting capillary length such that
CO2 flow starts above optimal and drops to optimal by the end of the
acquisition.

Q: Does standard error of the mean as a sample error agree with between target variability?

A: Initial data from identical samples run under similar conditions show standard deviation of around 1-1.5% for modern samples.
